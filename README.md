## About

Study Quest combines studying and gaming to encourage focus and productivity. We manage to do this by rewarding the user with in-game achievements and items. Studying more unlocks better items, which are used in battles against monsters. Unlike other game-and-study websites, progress and achievements will be saved rather than restarted. Study Quest is the perfect way to make studying fun and interactive.
